## From source

## TODO
- [ ] Cleanup client connection objects from `clientsMap` (memory leak)
- [ ] Websocket auto-reconnect
- [ ] JWT for messaging (server should accept only signed requests)
- [ ] Websocket & HTTP on the same port
- [ ] Possibility to change card variants (currently hard-coded)
